# bureaucratic_chess

A new Flutter project that's chess with a twist. There's a  Bureaucrat in here taking space and creating red Tape. Let me know waht you think.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Web Flutter application that's Bureacratic Chess.

The Bureaucrat. It can move to any unoccupied position on the board, but cannot capture pieces.

It's just there to get in the way and slow things down.
Not all of this variation's have been built, You can fork it and build if you want to.

BUREAUCRATIC CHESS: VARIANT RULE GUIDE

THE CORE PIECE: THE BUREAUCRAT (B)
(Applies to all variations)
 * Name: The Bureaucrat (B)
 * Movement: Can move to any unoccupied square on the board (an unblockable jump/teleport).
 * Capture Ability: Cannot capture any piece.
 * Vulnerability: Can be captured like any standard piece.
 * Check: Cannot deliver check.
 * Start Position: Starts off the board (auxiliary).
 * Entry Point: Available for deployment after Move 7 (White's 8th move or later).
 * Entry Action: A player uses a full turn to place their Bureaucrat onto any unoccupied square.

VARIATION 1: The Personal Obstacle (Baseline)
Key Difference: Simple, Permanent Obstruction.
 * Ownership: Two Bureaucrats (one for White, one for Black). Each player controls their own.
 * Action Cost: Moving or placing the Bureaucrat costs a full turn.
 * Check Evasion: CANNOT be moved to block a check.
 * Capture Effect: When captured, the Bureaucrat is simply removed. No special rules apply.
 * Strategic Focus: Using your move to plant a permanent obstruction on a key square (e.g., d4, e5) to force the opponent to spend their own time (1 tempo) capturing it or moving around it.

VARIATION 2: The Personal Obstacle with Red Tape
Key Difference: Capturing the piece causes the enemy piece to freeze.
 * Ownership: Two Bureaucrats (one for White, one for Black).
 * Action Cost: Moving or placing the Bureaucrat costs a full turn.
 * Check Evasion: CANNOT be moved to block a check.
 * Capture Effect (The Red Tape Rule):
   * When an opposing piece captures a Bureaucrat, that capturing piece MUST REMAIN STATIONARY on the capturer's subsequent turn.
   * Cost of Capture: The opponent spends 2 full moves (Tempo): 1 to capture, and 1 mandatory skip for the capturing piece.
 * Strategic Focus: The Bureaucrat is used as a tactical lure/sacrifice to freeze a high-value enemy piece (like a Queen or Rook) for a full turn, gaining a massive tempo advantage (effectively 2 moves) for counterplay.

VARIATION 3: Red Tape & Evasion (The Ultimate Tactic)
Key Difference: All the tactical benefits of V3, plus defensive power.
 * Ownership: Two Bureaucrats (one for White, one for Black).
 * Action Cost: Moving or placing the Bureaucrat costs a full turn.
 * Check Evasion (UPDATED): CAN be moved to block a check.
 * Capture Effect (The Red Tape Rule):
   * When an opposing piece captures a Bureaucrat, that capturing piece MUST REMAIN STATIONARY on the capturer's subsequent turn.
   * Cost of Capture: 2 full moves of tempo loss for the opponent.
 * Strategic Focus: Used as the ultimate defensive counter. In an attack, it can jump to block a check (evasion). The opponent must capture it to maintain the check/threat, but doing so immobilizes the attacking piece (Red Tape), giving the defender a powerful 2-move recovery/counter-attack window.
